A clean, single-file to-do list web app that lets you add tasks, mark them as done, and remove them. It stores your tasks in your browserâ€™s local storage so they persist between page reloads.

- Mark tasks as done/undone with a checkbox
- Remove tasks with a delete button
- Accessible and keyboard-friendly
- No build step; runs as a single HTML file

## Setup
- Download index.html and open it in any modern web browser.
- No server or dependencies required.

## Usage
- Add a task: Type a description in the input field and press Enter or click Add.
- Mark as done: Click the checkbox next to a task to toggle its completion state.
- Remove a task: Click the trash icon on the task you wish to delete.
- Your tasks are saved automatically in localStorage.
